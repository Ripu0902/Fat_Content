# Fat Content Prediction Model  

## Overview  
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for predicting fat content in food products. The model utilizes various data preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning techniques to analyze and predict fat content based on input features.  

## Dataset  
The dataset used in this notebook is read from CSV files (`train.csv` and `test.csv`). It undergoes preprocessing to handle missing values and improve model performance.  

## Key Features  
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, normalization, and feature selection.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Correlation matrix, visualizations, and statistical insights.  
- **Machine Learning Model:** A predictive model trained to estimate fat content using relevant features.  
- **Evaluation:** Model performance assessment with appropriate metrics.  

## Installation  
Ensure you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed. Then, install the required dependencies:  
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn klib
```  

## Usage  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/fat-content-prediction.git](https://github.com/Ripu0902/Fat_Content.git)
   cd fat-content-prediction
   ```  
2. Open the notebook in Jupyter:  
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook fat_Content_Model_21f3002511_v2.ipynb
   ```  
3. Run the cells to execute the analysis and model training.  

## Results  
The notebook includes insights into fat content prediction using machine learning. The correlation matrix and statistical analysis help in feature selection and performance optimization.
